I am a 4th year Computer Science student at Georgia Tech (Atlanta, GA), with hands-on experience in Python, C/C++, and Java for a variety of projects.

My primary interests lie in `Applied Machine Learning`, `Computational Media`, and `Human-Robot Interactions`.

My ethos is to put creativity and passion into my projects and take responsibility in team success by championing quality and proactive communication. Creative team culture is my passion and my obsession.
